      <h3>Family events and vacations</h3>
      <p>
        From The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints principles perspective, adding our family love and our family hardships in which we have seen many miracles, we want to share with our beloved children, posterity, extended families, and friends that we have a testimony that God and Christ exist, and they are also part of our eternal family; they yearn us to come back to them together. Therefore, they have provided a path for our return to be accomplished if we edify our agency wisely with a true heart's intent.
      </p>
      <p>Agency is a powerful gift from God, and sadly, we all make mistakes with it, which is why we need the Savior. The path is often called the restored Savior’s Gospel or plan of happiness. Also, our Savior through his restored church prophets teaches us that “We can take only three things to the next life: our Characters, Covenants, and Relationships” (CCR) and that “Our faith in Jesus Christ is the center of all we believe”. Appropriately, due to our agency errors and to improve our family relationships, we intend that this website could facilitate family reconciliations and true joy.
