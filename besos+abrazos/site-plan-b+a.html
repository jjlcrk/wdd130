      <h3>Family events and vacations</h3>
      <p>
        From our Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints principles perspective, adding our huge family love, and our family hardships; we want to share with our beloved children, posterity, extended families, and friends that we have a testimony that God and Christ exist, and they are also part of our eternal family; they yearn us to come back to them. Thus, they have provided a path for our return to be accomplished if we edify our agency wisely and with true heart intent. This path is often called the restored Savior’s Gospel or plan of happiness. Also, our Savior through his restored church prophets teaches us that we can take only three things to the next life: our Characters, our Covenants, and our Relationships (CCR). Consequently, in our desire to improve our family relationships, we intend that this website could facilitate family reconciliations and true joy.
      </p>
      <p>Keeping promises with God (or covenants) brings real joy, even if family events, vacations, or life are not perfect!</p>

      <p>
        In 2023 we had the privilege to visit relatives in Montevideo and Canelones, Uruguay. We also travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina. We encountered challenges, illnesses, disagreements, and family disputes, that at times made the dream vacation more like an adversity. However, we also experienced kindness, love, dedication, divine protection, and the Lord's tender mercies. As happens with most families and from a grateful perspective, this is a photographic telling and memories of some experiences tied to complicated and often dysfunctional family histories in all our family trees. It often shows the infinite power that lies within us, as we use some of God’s greatest gifts, our agency, covenants, relationships, and the Savior’s atonement.

      <h3>Page 3 "Family Vacations"</h3>
      <p>
        A few days after we arrived in Uruguay, Alejandra started developing a foot ailment to the point that she was not able to walk long without acute pain. However, we did our best to transport her in wheelchairs throughout the bus, boat, and taxi trips between Uruguay and Argentina. Unfortunately, she had to be grounded in a hotel room in Buenos Aires all the time. Nevertheless, this provided many service opportunities within our family to bring her food, needed health supplies, and new shoes; also, to keep her spirits up.
